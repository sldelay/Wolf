        A wolf’s howl is a method of communication that is the loudest when in harmony with others. A single wolf howl
        can be heard up to 10km.

        Their long muzzle ends with a hyper sensitive nose, which is one hundred times better than a human’s.

        Wolves are not particularly fast, with a top speed of about 45km/h (28mph). They instead rely on their hearing
        and sense of smell to detect prey. They have remarkable powers of endurance and are known to follow their target
        all day and night if necessary.
